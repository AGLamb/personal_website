## Overview
---
Welcome to my personal website, it is intended as a dynamic curriculum where I showcase my work. I aim to have an academic career in Economics with focus on its intersection with mathematics. I will be applying to selective doctoral programmes this upcoming fall, therefore I had to come up with ideas to differentiate my application. The idea to make this website was born during my Honours course in Rhetoric where I understood that showing, rather than telling, makes a message clear and concise. I want to show you what I love in this website so sometimes you will find the papers I have written or co-written, other times you will see projects that I develop in my free time. At last, I write this blog-style section as a professional journal where I will be recording the progress of all my different endeavours, however I do approach its writing-style in a more storytelling, less-rigorous way than my papers and reports such that it is accesible even for the non-initiated.

As a quick glance at the experience section in the home page would show you that my background is not the most common one for someone with my aspirations. I first went into Medical School before finding my true calling, then moving 9000km away from my family study a BSc in what I found to be the best approximation to this calling. Before medical school, I found myself trying to figure out why the human body worked, with special emphasis on the brain. Why the brain? Well, my biggest question lied into human behaviour. After having taken Neuroanatomy, Neurophysiology, Medical Psychology, Neurology and a long list of other courses, I realised that my curiosity was mainly driven not at the deterministic understanding of the way the brain works but rather to how humans could make better decisions. This was not the only factor, my curiosity had never been singular. I was always an overly curious kid with a knack for number and technology. I was always convinced that I would become a physicist (My second option for Major if I hadn't gone into Medical School) or mathematician (in a town with no Math major in its university), however this changed during high school when the aforementioned curiosity overtook the others. This is an overly simplistic explanation of the strange path you saw in my background.

Fast-forward to my freshman year in Economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, I found the reconciliation of my love for mathematics and my curiosity for modelling human behaviour and optimal decision making. However, my degree was less than satisfactory in fulfilling my math needs, so I started following the core curriculum of Econometrics. While back home (Mexico) Econometrics exists as an esoteric course that fails a large percent of student in business and economic majors, in The Netherlands it is a full-fledged discipline in which student get trained as mathematicians to later be shown the application in Economics. The first year of that programme involved Real Analysis, Differential Equations, rigorous Probability, Linear Algebra, Mathematical Statistics and a couple of introductory economics courses; on the other hand, I only had Linear Algebra and Calculus with the rest being Economics courses, with some very unnecessary filler courses in Business. You see, the educational system in Europe is quite different than in America, the whole curriculum tends to be set in stone with no space to take electives but until rather late. This meant that I could not tailor my programme to my more rigorous tase, so I ended up joining two full-time studies to fulfil this intellectual need, although I had to de-phase the timeline of the Econometrics studies to fit all of the courses in a feasible manner. This was very rewarding but yet exhausting as I was also enrolled in the Honours Programme of my faculty and I had to work a part-time job to make ends meet financially.

Now, I am on my way to the third year excited to be taking only math, stats and econometric courses such as Measure Theory, Time-series, Bayesian Econometrics and Topology. The year will also finish with a Honours thesis where I will be doing my own empirical research. Meanwhile, I hope this blog helps as an annotated, simplified version of what I am doing and that it sparks your interest in Economics and Math just as I needed back in Medical School. After this year, I will be pursuing Doctoral programmes in Economics, aspiring to an academic career that touches upon all my different intellectual pursuit. Hopefully, I will show the admission offices of my dream programmes that I am worthy of a place among their future alumni.

Andr√©s.
