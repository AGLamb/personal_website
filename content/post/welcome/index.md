## Overview
---
Welcome to my personal website, it is intended as a dynamic curriculum where I showcase my work. I aim to have an academic career in Economics with focus on the intersection with mathematics. I will be applying to selective doctoral programmes this upcoming fall, therefore I had to come up with ideas to differentiate my application. The idea to make this webiste was born during my Honours course in Rhetoric where I understood that showing, rather than telling, makes a message clear and concise. Therefore, I aim to show what I love in this website; sometime you will find the papers I have written or co-written, other times you will see projects that I develp in my free time. At last, I leave this blog-style section as a professional journal where I will be recording the progress of all different endeavors I start.
